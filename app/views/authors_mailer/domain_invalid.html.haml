  Hi there, your Listed domain settings were not configured properly.
  Please make sure you have an A record pointing to
  %strong 18.205.249.107,
  then
  %strong submit your domain request again via your author settings.
  You'll know you have it configured correctly if when you visit your custom domain, it shows an
  %i Invalid Certificate error.

%p Any questions? Please feel free to reply directly to this email.
